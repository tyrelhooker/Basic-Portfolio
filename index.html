            <p>I am an attorney turned web developer. I spent over four years practicing law before realizing that I am a "builder" and deciding that I needed to change careers to reach by full potential. My interest in web development began several years ago while I was taking an introductory course to programming. UNC's coding bootcamp is providing me the structure to expand upon my basic programming foundation and become a full-stack web developer.</p>
              
            <p>As a practicing attorney I represented numerous business clients, as well as individuals, in a wide variety of legal matters including, but not limited to: drafting contracts, business formations, real estate disputes, estate planning, litigation, and litigation defense. I have strong public speaking and facilitating skills and the ability to manage multiple complex projects. In addition, I am an expert researcher and a fast learner, with the ability to become competent in various subject matters and manage large volumes of data.</p>

            <p>I live in Wake Forest with my incredibly supportive <a href="assets/images/wife.jpg">wife</a> and our lovely boxer, <a href="assets/images/lady.jpg">Lady</a>. When I am not coding or practicing law, I enjoy spending time outside. Most of this time is spent doing <a href="assets/images/yardwork.jpg">yard work</a>, but I do have the opportunity to mountain bike and trail run every now and then. Finally, (but most importantly) I am a diehard <a href="assets/images/hookem.jpg">Texas Longhorn</a> and Dallas Cowboys fan. </p>
