            <p>I am an attorney turned web developer. I spent over four years practicing law before realizing that I am a "builder" and deciding that I needed to change careers to reach by full potential. My interest in programming began several years ago and I now have the opportunity to act upon my interest.</pr>
              
            <p>As an attorney I represented business clients, as well as individuals, in a wide variety of legal matters including, but not limited to: drafting contracts, business formations, real estate disputes, estate planning, litigation, and litigation defense. I have strong public speaking and facilitating skills and the ability to manage multiple complex projects. In addition, I an expert researcher and a fast learner, with the ability to become competent in various subject matters and manage large volumes of data.</p>

            <p>I live in Wake Forest with an incredibly supportive wife. We share our home with our boxer, Lady.While I am not coding or practicing law, I enjoy spending time outside. Most of this time is spent doing yard work, but I do have the opportunity to mountain bike and trail run every now and then. Finally, (but most importantly) I am a diehard Texas Longhorn and Dallas Cowboys fan. </p>
